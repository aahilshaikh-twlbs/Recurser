Veo prompt guide
This section contains examples of videos you can create using Veo, and shows you how to modify prompts to produce distinct results.

Safety filters
Veo applies safety filters across Gemini to help ensure that generated videos and uploaded photos don't contain offensive content. Prompts that violate our terms and guidelines are blocked.

Prompt writing basics
Good prompts are descriptive and clear. To get the most out of Veo, start with identifying your core idea, refine your idea by adding keywords and modifiers, and incorporate video-specific terminology into your prompts.

The following elements should be included in your prompt:

Subject: The object, person, animal, or scenery that you want in your video, such as cityscape, nature, vehicles, or puppies.
Action: What the subject is doing (for example, walking, running, or turning their head).
Style: Specify creative direction using specific film style keywords, such as sci-fi, horror film, film noir, or animated styles like cartoon.
Camera positioning and motion: [Optional] Control the camera's location and movement using terms like aerial view, eye-level, top-down shot, dolly shot, or worms eye.
Composition: [Optional] How the shot is framed, such as wide shot, close-up, single-shot or two-shot.
Focus and lens effects: [Optional] Use terms like shallow focus, deep focus, soft focus, macro lens, and wide-angle lens to achieve specific visual effects.
Ambiance: [Optional] How the color and light contribute to the scene, such as blue tones, night, or warm tones.
More tips for writing prompts
Use descriptive language: Use adjectives and adverbs to paint a clear picture for Veo.
Enhance the facial details: Specify facial details as a focus of the photo like using the word portrait in the prompt.

Prompting for audio
With Veo 3, you can provide cues for sound effects, ambient noise, and dialogue. The model captures the nuance of these cues to generate a synchronized soundtrack.

Dialogue: Use quotes for specific speech. (Example: "This must be the key," he murmured.)
Sound Effects (SFX): Explicitly describe sounds. (Example: tires screeching loudly, engine roaring.)
Ambient Noise: Describe the environment's soundscape. (Example: A faint, eerie hum resonates in the background.)
These videos demonstrate prompting Veo 3's audio generation with increasing levels of detail.

A close up of two people staring at a cryptic drawing on a wall, torchlight flickering. "This must be the key," he murmured, tracing the pattern. "What does it mean though?" she asked, puzzled, tilting her head. Damp stone, intricate carvings, hidden symbols. A faint, eerie hum resonates in the background.	Treasure hunters in a cave.

Using reference images to generate videos
You can animate everyday objects, bring drawings and paintings to life, and add movement and sound to nature scenes, using Veo's image-to-video capability.

Prompt	Generated output
Input Image (Generated by Imagen)
Bunny with a chocolate candy bar.	Bunny is running away.
Output Video (Generated by Veo 3)
Bunny runs away.	Bunny is running away.
Tip: For the best results and a more natural progression, select a photo closest to what you envision as the first scene of your video, since Veo uses the photo as the initial frame.
Example prompts and output
This section presents several prompts, highlighting how descriptive details can elevate the outcome of each video.

Icicles
This video demonstrates how you can use the elements of prompt writing basics in your prompt.

Prompt	Generated output
Close up shot (composition) of melting icicles (subject) on a frozen rock wall (context) with cool blue tones (ambiance), zoomed in (camera motion) maintaining close-up detail of water drips (action).	Dripping icicles with a blue background.
Man on the phone
These videos demonstrate how you can revise your prompt with increasingly specific details to get Veo to refine the output to your liking.

Prompt	Generated output
Less detail
The camera dollies to show a close up of a desperate man in a green trench coat. He's making a call on a rotary-style wall phone with a green neon light. It looks like a movie scene.	Man talking on the phone.
More detail
A close-up cinematic shot follows a desperate man in a weathered green trench coat as he dials a rotary phone mounted on a gritty brick wall, bathed in the eerie glow of a green neon sign. The camera dollies in, revealing the tension in his jaw and the desperation etched on his face as he struggles to make the call. The shallow depth of field focuses on his furrowed brow and the black rotary phone, blurring the background into a sea of neon colors and indistinct shadows, creating a sense of urgency and isolation.

Snow leopard
Prompt	Generated output
Simple prompt:
A cute creature with snow leopard-like fur is walking in winter forest, 3D cartoon style render.	Snow leopard is lethargic.
Detailed prompt:
Create a short 3D animated scene in a joyful cartoon style. A cute creature with snow leopard-like fur, large expressive eyes, and a friendly, rounded form happily prances through a whimsical winter forest.

The creature's bouncy movements and wide smile should convey pure delight. Aim for an upbeat, heartwarming tone with bright, cheerful colors and playful animation.	Snow leopard is running faster.
